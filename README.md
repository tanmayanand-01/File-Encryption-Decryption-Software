# File-Encryption-Decryption-Software
It is a basic file encryption and decryption software implemented in C++, utilizing the Caesar Cipher technique as the core logic.



# HOW TO RUN:-

Step 1:- Prepare the File: The file should be in the same directory. A sample file named sample.txt is included in the repository for testing purposes.

Step 2:- Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is located on your local device.

Step 3:- Run the following command to compile the program.

         g++ main.cpp encryption.cpp

Step 4:- Execute the compiled file with the command

         ./a.out

Step 5:- Enter the name of the file you wish to encrypt or decrypt. (Ensure the file is in the same directory as the program. For example, sample.txt.)

Step 6:- Choose an Option:

         Enter 'e' to encrypt the file.
         Enter 'd' to decrypt the file.
         
Step 7:- A new file will be created in the same directory with the processed content.
